# mini tic-tac-toe game which is as broken as it gets (perhaps not though)

## To do:
- make it print out the board properly 
    - **done that, ez af**
    
- inject player-symbol into the board according to (x,y) pos 
    - **done that, ez as well**

- track which player's turn it is properly 
    - **kinda but not really, know what i mean?** 

### v.'nice' - nice (ironic that its not the same push, haha)

to compile with custom name:
```bash
g++ tic-tac.cpp -o custom_name
```
